# Multithread-test

This repository shows different sorting algorithms implementations, including the ones with multithreaded programming (Quick sort, Merge sort), and analysis of the library sorting algorithms - both parallel, vectorized and sequential executions (C++17)

# Analysis

The parallel speedup is calculated by using the following equation:
